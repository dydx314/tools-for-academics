Some useful tools for undergraduate mathematics, statistics, biology, economics and more.

## Tool 1: RNA to Protein (VHSO-friendly)

### Details:
This code takes in an **RNA string**, and produces the **first peptide chain** generated by the ribosome. 

### Usage instructions (Non-Git):
1. `Download ZIP` on top-right corner and unzip.
2. Save the `RNAtoProtein` folder to your `GVHSSA` folder.
3. Go to the **Command Line (Windows) / Terminal (Mac)**, and into your `RNAtoProtein` folder using `cd`

In this example, I saved the `RNAtoProtein` folder in my `Desktop`'s `GVHSSA` folder's `github` folder's `GVHSSA` folder.
Therefore I would do (on a Mac it would look like):
```

Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:~ chessmaster$ cd Desktop
Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:Desktop chessmaster$ cd GVHSSA
Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:GVHSSA chessmaster$ cd github
Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:github chessmaster$ cd GVHSSA
Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:GVHSSA chessmaster$ cd RNAtoProtein
```
What you type should go after the `$` sign.

4. Type the following code to run:
```
Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:RNAtoProtein chessmaster$ g++ protein-translation.cpp -o protein-translation.run
Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:RNAtoProtein chessmaster$ ./protein-translation.run
```

5. It is running! Input your RNA and get your protein! Sample input with start and stop codons:
  `AUGUUCGACCAGUAG`



### Usage instructions (Git):
1. Download and install Git if you have not yet.
2. Go to the **Command Line/Terminal**, and into your `GVHSSA` folder using `cd`

In this example, I saved the `GVHSSA` folder in my `Desktop`.
Therefore I would do (on a Mac it would look like):
```

Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:Desktop chessmaster$ cd GVHSSA
```
What you type should go after the `$` sign.

3. Type the following code:
```
Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:GVHSSA chessmaster$ git clone https://github.com/mrchessmaster/GVHSSA.git
Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:GVHSSA chessmaster$ cd GVHSSA
Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:GVHSSA chessmaster$ cd RNAtoProtein
```

4. Type the following code to run:
```
Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:RNAtoProtein chessmaster$ g++ protein-translation.cpp -o protein-translation.run
Davids-MacBook-Pro-3:RNAtoProtein chessmaster$ ./protein-translation.run
```
